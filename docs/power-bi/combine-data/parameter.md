# 1. Introduction to Power Query Parameters

Imagine you've built a Power BI report that connects to an Excel file located in a specific folder on your computer. What if that file moves, or you want to use the same report structure but with a different file (e.g., `Sales_2023.xlsx` vs. `Sales_2024.xlsx`) or even a different folder (e.g., a "Development" folder versus a "Production" folder)? Without parameters, you would have to manually edit the data source settings for each change, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.

This is where **parameters** come in!

* **What are Parameters?**
    Parameters in Power Query are essentially **placeholders** or **variables** that hold a specific value. Instead of hardcoding values directly into your queries (like a file path or a specific year), you can use a parameter. When the underlying value needs to change, you simply update the parameter, and all queries that use it will adapt automatically.

* **Why Use Them?**
    Parameters provide **flexibility** and **reusability** to your Power Query solutions. They allow you to:
  * Make your data sources dynamic.
  * Apply filters and transformations dynamically.
  * Create reusable report templates that can connect to different data.
  * Improve maintainability by centralizing changeable values.

* **Common Use Cases:**
  * Defining file or folder paths.
  * Specifying database server names or table names.
  * Setting filtering criteria (e.g., start/end dates for a report).
  * Controlling report logic (e.g., a threshold value).

### Types of Parameters

Parameters can hold various types of values, just like columns in your data:

* **Text:** For file paths, server names, table names, or any string values.
* **Number:** For quantities, thresholds, years, or numerical IDs.
* **Date/Time:** For start dates, end dates, or specific timestamps.
* **True/False (Logical):** For conditional logic.
* **List of Values:** To provide a dropdown selection for users (e.g., a list of years to choose from).

## 2. Key Benefits of Using Parameters

Using parameters fundamentally changes how you manage and interact with your data model.

1. **Dynamic Data Sources:**
    * You can easily switch between different files (e.g., `Sales_North.xlsx`, `Sales_South.xlsx`) or even different data environments (e.g., a test database vs. a live production database) without altering your query steps.
    * **Impact:** Saves time, reduces errors, and makes reports adaptable to different scenarios.

2. **Filter/Transform Data Dynamically:**
    * Instead of hardcoding a filter for "Year = 2024," you can set "Year = `ReportYearParameter`." Your users can then change `ReportYearParameter` in Power BI Desktop or Service to view data for different years.
    * **Impact:** Creates interactive and customizable reports, empowering users to explore data more flexibly.

3. **Reusable Queries / Report Templates:**
    * You can design a generic Power BI report that uses parameters for all its data sources. Then, by simply changing the parameter values, you can instantly apply that report to different data sets without rebuilding it from scratch.
    * **Impact:** Promotes efficiency, consistency, and standardizes reporting across an organization.

4. **Security and Access Control (Indirectly):**
    * While not a direct security feature, parameters can abstract away complex connection strings or internal data structures from end-users, simplifying their interaction while maintaining robust data handling behind the scenes.
    * **Impact:** Cleaner user experience, less exposure to underlying data complexities.

## 3. Practical Example 1: Dynamic File Path (Text Parameter)

Let's imagine you have sales data stored in an Excel file. This file might reside in different locations (e.g., a development folder during testing, then a production folder when deployed). We'll use a parameter to handle this.

**Scenario:** We want to load `SalesData.xlsx` but make its folder path dynamic.

**Steps in Power Query Editor:**

1. **Open Power Query Editor:**
    * In Power BI Desktop, go to the "Home" tab and click "Transform data."

2. **Create a New Parameter:**
    * In the Power Query Editor, go to the "Home" tab on the ribbon.
    * In the "Parameters" group, click "Manage Parameters" -> "New Parameter."
    * Fill in the details for your new parameter:
        * **Name:** `SalesFolderPath` (a descriptive name)
        * **Description:** "The folder path where sales files are located."
        * **Type:** `Text` (since it's a file path)
        * **Suggested Values:** `Any`
        * **Current Value:** Type an example path for your sales file's folder, e.g., `C:\PowerBIData\Sales\`
    * Click "OK." You will now see `SalesFolderPath` listed in your "Queries" pane on the left.

3. **Connect to a Folder (Using the Parameter):**
    * Go to the "Home" tab -> "New Source" -> "More..."
    * Search for "Folder" and select it. Click "Connect."
    * In the Folder dialog box, instead of typing a path, select "Parameter" from the dropdown.
    * Choose your `SalesFolderPath` parameter.
    * Click "OK."
    * Power Query will show you the files in the folder specified by your parameter.
    * Find your `SalesData.xlsx` file in the list and click "Transform Data" next to it (or "Binary" then "Excel.Workbook" in the formula bar if you already connected to a specific file directly).
    * Navigate through the Excel workbook to the sheet you want to load (e.g., `Sheet1`). Click "OK."
    * Rename this query to `SalesData`.

4. **Observe the Parameter in Action:**
    * Now, if you want to change the folder path, you don't need to re-do all the connection steps.
    * In the "Queries" pane, click on the `SalesFolderPath` parameter.
    * In the "Parameter" settings area (usually below the ribbon), you can change the "Current Value" to a different folder path (e.g., `C:\PowerBIData\Archive\`).
    * Once you change it, click back on your `SalesData` query. Power Query will automatically update and attempt to load data from the *new* folder path. You might need to click "Refresh Preview" in the "Home" tab to see the change.
    * **Reasoning:** By using a parameter, we've decoupled the query logic from the specific, hardcoded folder location. The query now uses the value stored in the `SalesFolderPath` parameter, making it flexible.

## 4. Practical Example 2: Dynamic Data Filtering (Number Parameter)

Let's assume you have a `FactSales` table loaded in Power Query, and it contains sales transactions for multiple years. We want to dynamically filter this data to show only a specific reporting year.

**Scenario:** Filter `FactSales` data to display only a selected year.

**Steps in Power Query Editor:**

1. **Assume `FactSales` is Loaded:**
    * For this example, imagine you have a query named `FactSales` that contains an `OrderDate` column, among others. (If not, quickly load a small sample table with dates into Power Query.)

2. **Create a New Parameter for the Year:**
    * Go to the "Home" tab -> "Manage Parameters" -> "New Parameter."
    * Fill in the details:
        * **Name:** `SelectedReportYear`
        * **Description:** "The year for which to display sales data."
        * **Type:** `Whole Number` (since a year is a whole number)
        * **Suggested Values:** `List of Values` (Optional, but good for user selection later). Add a few years like `2023`, `2024`, `2025`.
        * **Current Value:** Set it to `2024`.
    * Click "OK."

3. **Apply the Filter to `FactSales` Using the Parameter:**
    * Click on your `FactSales` query in the "Queries" pane.
    * Find the `OrderDate` column. If it's not already a Date/Time type, right-click on the column header and select "Change Type" -> "Date."
    * Click the filter arrow on the `OrderDate` column header.
    * Select "Date Filters" -> "Is in year..." (or "Number Filters" after extracting the year).
    * Instead of selecting a specific year from a list or typing a number directly, you'll need to modify the formula bar.
    * First, apply any simple filter (e.g., "Is in year 2024") to generate the initial filter step.
    * Now, look at the **Formula Bar** (if not visible, go to "View" tab and check "Formula Bar"). The filter step will look something like this:
        `= Table.SelectRows(#"Previous Step", each Date.Year([OrderDate]) = 2024)`
    * Modify this line to use your parameter. Replace `2024` with `SelectedReportYear`:
        `= Table.SelectRows(#"Previous Step", each Date.Year([OrderDate]) = SelectedReportYear)`
    * Press Enter.
    * **Reasoning:** We've replaced a hardcoded year with a parameter. Now, whenever `SelectedReportYear` changes, this filter step will automatically re-evaluate based on the new year.

4. **Test the Dynamic Filter:**
    * Click on the `SelectedReportYear` parameter in the "Queries" pane.
    * Change its "Current Value" to `2023` (or any other year you added to the list).
    * Click back on your `FactSales` query. The preview will automatically update to show only sales data for the year 2023. You might need to click "Refresh Preview" in the "Home" tab if it doesn't update immediately.

## 5. Managing Parameters

Once you've created parameters in Power Query, they aren't just for use within the Editor. They extend into Power BI Desktop and the Power BI Service.

* **In Power BI Desktop (After "Close & Apply"):**
  * After you "Close & Apply" your queries, parameters become available in Power BI Desktop's main interface.
  * Go to the "Home" tab on the ribbon.
  * In the "Queries" group, click "Transform data" -> "Edit parameters."
  * A dialog box will appear, allowing you to change the current values for your parameters (e.g., `SalesFolderPath`, `SelectedReportYear`).
  * When you click "OK," Power BI will automatically refresh the queries that depend on these parameters with their new values. This makes it incredibly easy to switch environments or filter data without re-opening Power Query Editor.

* **In Power BI Service (for Published Reports):**
  * When you publish a report with parameters to the Power BI Service, you can manage parameter values as part of your dataset's settings.
  * This is especially useful for scheduled refreshes or when deploying the same report to different workspaces with distinct data sources (e.g., one workspace for "North Region" data, another for "South Region" data, both driven by a `RegionParameter`).
  * You would navigate to your dataset in the Power BI Service, go to "Settings," and then find the "Parameters" section to update their values.
