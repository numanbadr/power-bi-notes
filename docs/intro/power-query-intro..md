# What is Power Query?

Think of Power Query as the **kitchen of Power BI**. It's where you take your raw, messy ingredients (your data) and prepare them—chopping, mixing, and cleaning—before you start cooking (creating your data model and reports).

Technically, Power Query is a data connection and data preparation technology. Its primary purpose is to perform **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** operations.

## Key Functions of Power Query

- **Connect (Extract):** Connect to hundreds of different data sources, from simple Excel files to complex databases and web services.
- **Transform:** This is the core of Power Query. You can clean, shape, merge, and reshape your data to meet your analysis needs. This is what we will focus on.
- **Combine:** Merge or append multiple tables or files into a single, unified table.
- **Load:** Load the prepared data into the Power BI data model (the Power Pivot engine) where you can create relationships and write DAX measures.

The exam heavily emphasizes your ability to use the Power Query Editor to profile, clean, and shape data. A significant portion of the "Prepare the Data" domain is dedicated to these skills. Mastering Power Query is non-negotiable for passing the PL-300.
